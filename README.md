# Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling of Arctic Sea Ice Extent

## 🌍 Overview
This project investigates the temporal and regional variability of **Arctic sea ice extent** using **Bayesian hierarchical modeling**. We compare two models:
1. A **Bayesian Hierarchical Non-Autoregressive model (No-AR)** that assumes independent residuals.
2. An **Bayesian Hierarchical Autoregressive model (AR(1))**, which captures temporal dependence in residuals.

Using data from the **[National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02135/north/)**, we assess whether accounting for temporal correlation improves predictive performance. The findings provide insights into the declining trends in sea ice extent and highlight key regional differences.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Temporal Trends**: The AR(1) model significantly improves predictive performance by capturing year-to-year dependencies in sea ice extent.
- **Regional Variability**: Different Arctic regions exhibit varying rates of sea ice decline, with some regions more stable while others show rapid reduction.
- **Model Performance**: Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) revealed that the AR(1) model achieved an **ELPD improvement of 73.3 units (SE = 27.6)** over the No-AR model, indicating a meaningful enhancement in predictive accuracy.

---

## 📌 Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data Processing**
- Data from **NSIDC**: Monthly sea ice extent for 14 Arctic regions (1979–2023)
- Preprocessing: Aggregated to annual means, log-transformed for stability
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Distribution analysis, time series trends, regional comparisons

### **2️⃣ Bayesian Hierarchical Models**
#### **📌 Model 1: Bayesian Hierarchical Non-Autoregressive (No-AR)**
- Hierarchical model with region-specific intercepts
- Assumes independent residuals across time
- Captures inter-regional differences but ignores temporal dependencies

#### **📌 Model 2: Bayesian Hierarchical Autoregressive AR(1)**
- Extends No-AR by introducing an **AR(1) structure** in residuals
- Models year-to-year correlation, accounting for persistence in sea ice dynamics

### **3️⃣ Model Comparison & Evaluation**
- **Convergence Diagnostics**: Effective sample size (ESS), R-hat, trace plots
- **Predictive Performance**: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO)
- **Statistical Interpretation**: Posterior distributions, credible intervals, and regional trends

## 🔥 Results & Visualizations
### **📌 Overall Sea Ice Decline**
![Overall Sea Ice Trend](figures/eda_time_series_overall_improved.png)
📌 The figure above shows a significant **downward shift in sea ice extent after 2000**, highlighting the increasing impact of climate change.

### **📌 Regional Variability in Sea Ice Extent**
![Regional Sea Ice Trend](figures/eda_time_series_facets_logY.png)
📌 Different Arctic regions exhibit unique trends. Some show **gradual decline**, while others remain relatively stable.

### **📌 Model Comparison: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO)**
| Model       | ELPD Difference | SE Difference |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **AR(1)**  | **0.0**       | **0.0**       |
| **No-AR**  | -73.3         | 27.6         |
📌 The AR(1) model outperforms the No-AR model by a significant margin, indicating that **temporal correlation is a key factor in predictive accuracy**.

## **🚀 Installation & Usage Guide**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r-a-j/Applied-Bayesian-Data-Analysis.git
cd Applied-Bayesian-Data-Analysis

```

### **📌 Requirements**

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the analysis.

#### **🔹 For R:**

Run the following command in the **R console** to install required packages:

```r
source("r_requirements.R")

```

#### **🔹 For Python (pip users):**

Run in the **terminal**:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

#### **🔹 For Python (Conda users):**

If you prefer **Conda**, set up the environment with:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sea_ice_analysis

```

----------

### **📌 Running the Analysis**

Once dependencies are installed, execute the analysis steps in order:

1️⃣ **Run Data Preprocessing**

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --execute --inplace preprocess.ipynb

```

2️⃣ **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

```r
rmarkdown::render("exploratory_data_analysis.Rmd")

```

3️⃣ **Fit Hierarchical Bayesian Models with Normal Priors**

```r
source("analysis_normal_priors.R")

```

4️⃣ **Fit Hierarchical Bayesian Models with Alternative Priors**

```r
source("analysis_alternative_priors.R")

```

----------

### **💡 Notes:**

-   Ensure that **R and Python are installed** before running the commands.
-   **For R users:** The `r_requirements.R` script automatically installs missing packages.
-   **For Jupyter Notebook users:** Ensure you have `nbconvert` installed for running `.ipynb` files from the terminal.

## 📌 Future Work
- **Higher temporal resolution**: Extending the model to monthly/seasonal data.

- **Additional climate variables**: Including sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure indices.

- **Non-linear modeling**: Exploring Gaussian processes and splines for improved flexibility.

- **Refined LOO estimates**: Using moment matching for more precise model comparisons.
